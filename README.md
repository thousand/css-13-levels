Presentation page for my "CSS in 13 Levels" talk

## How to navigate

There are hidden links on the left and right sides of the top half of the pages. 
The left one goes "back", the right one goes "forward". 
The giant cursor will also change to indicate that's where you are,
while a transition slowly makes the text visible over time.
